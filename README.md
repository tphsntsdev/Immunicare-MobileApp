The Immunicare Mobile Application is an Android mobile application built with Kotlin and Gradle. It serves as a task-driven chatbot, providing users with essential information about vaccines, nearest vaccination locations (clinics/hospitals), and facilitating appointment scheduling. Additionally, users can view their vaccination certificates after verification through an admin interface linked to Immunicare Admin Interface.

Features:

  • Chatbot Interface: Easily ask questions about vaccines and receive instant answers.

  • Location Services: Utilize Google Maps API to find the nearest vaccination clinics and hospitals.

  • Appointment Scheduling: Users can book vaccination appointments directly within the app.

  • Vaccination Certificates: View certificates after admin verification through a separate repository.
